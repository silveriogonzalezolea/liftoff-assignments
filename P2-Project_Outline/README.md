## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Sometime ago I was interested in scientific databases. I ended up learning way to much about the academic research industry. But I found a website called arXiv.org. The website essentially helps professors share research without having to go to any publishing houses. This got me thinking about how to include randomness to the scientific discovery process. 

TheBoredProffessor is a web application that will be hookup to a scientific database. It will only allow you to enter a single topic in the search box, then it will randomly give you different research articles.
